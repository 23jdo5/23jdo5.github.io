# Jonathan Do's Portfolio
Hello! My name is Jonathan Do, I am a computer science major, attending [CSUF](https://www.fullerton.edu), and I am expected to graduate in 2027. My GitHub profile link is [https://github.com/23jdo5](https://github.com/23jdo5).

## Favorite CPSC120 Labs. 

Lab 4, Part 1: [Repository Link](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-samantha-and-jonathan)

  Lab 4, part 1 was enjoyable because each line of code built off of each other. Converting the metric system to the U.S. system was an extremely fun lab to do while also teaching me how to build off of the previous code. It was useful to learn and easy to do. The conversion also let me practice using math in code and identify which symbol meant which mathematical symbol. 


Lab 7, part 2: [Repository Link](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-jonathan-and-dylan)
	
  Lab 7, and part 2 was extremely fun because this lab was somewhat unique. We had to create a code that needed to follow specific times and places to real-world things. Going back and forth between the parking pictures was tedious, but also something new and different. The actual code was fairly difficult and provided a challenge, the usage of if and bool statements confused my partner and I for a very long time. Having to balance out which dates were available and unavailable, and what days were permitted or not, the code was fairly difficult. It was fun to complete and added to the satisfaction of accomplishing the code. 

Lab 9, part 2: [Repository Link](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-sam-and-jonathan)
	
  Lab 9, and part 2 was fun, with the conflicting schedule between the philosophers and the narrative that both philosophers hated each other. The lab was a fun one with my partner to do. This lab reminded me of lab 7, part 2 as that lab also dealt with schedules and time. However, the philosopher's schedules were different, with contrasting ones that we could not allow to overlap. Although I believe that this lab was simpler, it still provided a challenge for us to accomplish.
