#Favorite CPSC120 Labs. 

Lab 4, Part 1:

  Lab 4, part 1 was enjoyable because each line of code built off of each other. Converting the metric system to the U.S. system was an extremely fun lab to do while also teaching me how to build off of the previous code. It was useful to learn and easy to do. The conversion also let me practice using math in code and identify which symbol meant which mathematical symbol. 


Lab 7, part 2
	
  Lab 7, and part 2 was extremely fun because this lab was somewhat unique. We had to create a code that needed to follow specific times and places to real-world things. Going back and forth between the parking pictures was tedious, but also something new and different. The actual code was fairly difficult and provided a challenge that once my partner and I accomplished, we felt immense satisfaction. 

Lab 9, part 2
	
  Lab 9, and part 2 was fun, with the conflicting schedule between the philosophers and the narrative that both philosophers hated each other. The lab was a fun one with my partner to do. It was simple, especially after lab 7 which had a harder version of what this part of the lab was, but it was something that I still enjoyed.
